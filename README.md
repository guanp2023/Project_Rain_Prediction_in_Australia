Project - Rain Prediction in Australia

Introduction:

In this project, you are tasked to predict the rain in Australia. You would use the following classification algorithms to create a model based on the training data, and evaluate the testing data using the following evaluation metrics.

Classification algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy Score
- Jaccard Index
- F1-Score
- LogLoss
- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- R2-Score

Finally, you will use your models to generate a report at the end.
